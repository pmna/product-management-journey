# My 5 key takeaways as a Digital Product Manager from 2021

Top 5 Learnings from 2021

* "Challenge norms, push boundaries, don't fear mistakes and always be open to learning." - JJ Wilson *

When I was brought onboard in late 2020, I was given the mandate to build a new user-friendly application that would allow us to kill the legacy application
that was being used at that point of time. 

The legacy application was built for our internal teams to help find out and fix the issues being faced by users from a technical standpoint. Over the course
of time, other teams started using this application more and more. Since, this was not the original intent of building it, it was becoming quite cumbersome 
to maintain the data and to update the application as per the business users' specifications. 

Building a new product to replace an existing one is no small feat. Majorly, because your users are accustomed to a certain way of using the application and to break an existing habit is very difficult involving several protracted negotiations between all concerned parties.
We were able to bring out the new application in mid-2021 and the users loved it and thus, enabling us to finally let go of the legacy system.
It has been quite an eventful ride thus far which I have thoroughly enjoyed and keenly look forward to learning newer things to help improve myself while continuously striving to implement the learnings that I have listed below in all my endeavors.

## Lesson #1: Keep your Target segment engaged in the Design and Development right from the beginning - Wireframe helps

Building applications for internal users will be different from building applications for external users. But the essence remains the same and that is to ensure that you reach out to your target segment and involve them from the beginning.
Include your UX designer in these meetings as this helps to convey that you are serious in designing user-focused applications. Another advantage of this process is that during discussions, the designer could quickly grasp the user inputs and help create a UX wireframe that keeps those requirements in focus.
Most people respond to visual stimuli and hence, always try to bring a wireframe to the discussion to help them understand what you have in your mind. Presenting only datapoints will just confuse them.
The wireframe need not have all the bells and whistles. It could be a basic wireframe to help convey the concept to the users and to help them to provide inputs regarding what and how they would like to view the information on the application.

## Lesson #2: Over-communication is always better

Whether it is a new startup or a well-funded startup or an established firm, the management style differs. But, in whichever type of organization you work, the higher-ups would always be interested with the development progress and deliverable timelines.
And even though the user might not be interested with the technical development progress, they would always be keen to know the delivery timelines.
Keeping this in mind, it is always good to have regular review sessions with the users and management to ensure that all are on the same page regarding the development and timelines. This ensures that they are aware of any known or unknown delays and there is no major escalation(s) taking place which would only divert the time and attention to douse the fire instead of focusing on the product/solution development.
It is a good practice to send regular updates via emails detailing the features and functionalities deployed as part of the release and the target planned for the next release.

## Lesson #3: Learn how to say No

A product is typically not built for one specific user, but for a group of users and hence there will be different set of requirements from various users. We need to strategize the requirements to ensure that they are in line with the vision of the product/solution.
Thus, if there are requirements which do not fit with the overall vision, we need to communicate the same with the users. I utilize the MoSCoW prioritization framework with my users to help them identify which requirements make a better fit to the product scope and which ones are mere embellishments.

## Lesson #4: Empathize towards your users and your team

Customer empathy is required to understand their needs (overt and latent) and pain points. Our target users were pleasantly surprised when we brought our first developed wireframe to them and it really helped kickstart their continuous journey with us to help design a product that they themselves would regularly use.
It is also important to empathize with the team as the members would not be at their peak productivity all at the same time. Every team usually consists of two types of workers: smart workers and hard workers. Both are equally required for a successful delivery.
Usually, the smart workers are the spirit of the team and help make the team a more cohesive unit. The hard workers are typically a quiet lot and are usually considered to be slow with their deliverables. But, quite a few times in my career, I have observed them to provide good insights into a deliverable and find out bugs or issues which weren't considered by anyone.

## Lesson #5: Ensure that your UX designer and your Development Team are in sync with the designs

Early on, during the initial phase when we kickstarted our product development journey, our designer would bring out awesome UX design screens for the UI. But our UI developers would struggle to deliver the same output as shown on the screens.
This scenario typically plays out due to two reasons: Either the UI developers are not experienced enough to bring those screens to life, or the designs could not be developed through existing technology stack defined for the development.
This creates unnecessary friction between the team members and leads to constant trade-off on the design.
To avoid this scenario, it is encouraged to have Design Sprints to ensure that the designs are getting finalized as per the technical strength of the developers and helps push the developers to build upon their technical expertise to help provide amazing user experience.
Hope these learnings also help you in your journey as a Product Manager.
